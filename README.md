# ADVD-Analog-Project

Designed a two stage single-ended output OpAmp (differential +gain stage) for the following specifications 

i) DC gain ≥ 80 dB 
ii) UGB ≥ 400MHz 
iii) Output voltage swing ≥ 2V 
iv) PSRR ≥ 120dB 
v) Output offset voltage ≤ 40mV 

b)A biasing circuitry to bias all the voltages in the design (except the input). 

c) STB analysis to calculate the closed loop gain and phase margin for the OpAmp. 

d) Calculated and plotted the following parameters for the OPAMP: DC gain, Bode plot for AC gain and phase, CMRR plot, ICMR plot, PSRR plot, slew rate, settling time, Output voltage swing (dc + Transient), power consumption, and input and output offset voltage.
